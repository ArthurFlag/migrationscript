title: Enable OAUTH2/OIDC authentication for Aiven for Apache Kafka速
---

## Prerequisites

Aiven for Apache Kafka integrates with a wide range of OpenID Connect
identity providers (IdPs). However, the exact configuration steps can
differ based on your chosen IdP. Refer to your Identity Provider's
official documentation for specific configuration guidelines.

Before proceeding with the setup, ensure you have:

-   [Aiven for Apache Kafka速](/docs/products/kafka/getting-started) service running.
-   **Access to an OIDC provider**: Options include Auth0, Okta, Google
    Identity Platform, Azure, or any other OIDC compliant provider.
-   Required configuration details from your OIDC provider:
    -   **JWKS Endpoint URL**: URL to retrieve the JSON Web Key Set
        (JWKS).
    -   **Subject Claim Name**: Typically \"sub\"; however, this may
        vary with your OIDC provider.
    -   **Issuer URL or Identifier**: Identifies and verifies the JWT
        issuer.
    -   **Audience Identifier(s)**: Validates the JWT\'s intended
        recipients. For multiple audiences, make a note of all.

To assign a standalone project to an organization or unit use the
following call. Replace `ACCOUNT_ID` with the ID of the organization or
unit and `PROJECT_NAME` with the name of the project to assign.

```
curl -sXPUT \
 https://api.aiven.io/v1/project/PROJECT_NAME \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
 -H 'content-type: application/json' \
 --data-raw '{"account_id":"ACCOUNT_ID","add_account_owners_admin_access":true}' | jq
```

### Create an organization {#create-org-api}

To create an organization use the following call. Replace `ORG_NAME`
with a name for your new organization.

```
curl -sXPOST \
 https://api.aiven.io/v1/account \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
 -H 'content-type: application/json' \
 --data '{"account_name":"ORG_NAME"}' | jq
```
